# Platform behaviour and permissions

What each OS allows a clipboard manager to do, which permissions Clipboard
Sync needs, and what the app does about the gaps. Settings → *Permissions*
shows the same guidance in-app together with a live **Test** button.

| | Background capture | Global hotkey | Start at login | OS permission prompts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | Yes — polls `NSPasteboard.changeCount`, reads on change | Yes (Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`, no Accessibility access needed) | Launch Agent in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` | Possible one-time pasteboard prompt on macOS 26+; Local Network prompt for LAN databases; keychain prompt on unsigned builds (see below) |
| Windows | Yes — `AddClipboardFormatListener` | Yes (`RegisterHotKey`) | `HKCU\…\Run` value | None |
| Linux (X11 / XWayland) | Yes — GTK clipboard polling | Yes (keybinder) | `~/.config/autostart/*.desktop` | None. Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet) used for credentials when present |
| Linux (native Wayland) | Only while focused | No | same | The app defaults to XWayland (`GDK_BACKEND=x11`); set `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` to override |
| Android | No — Android 10+ serves clipboard reads only to the focused app | n/a | n/a | No permission exists. Android 12+ shows a "pasted from …" notice on each read |
| iOS | No — never in background | n/a | n/a | "Allow Paste?" on reads of content from other apps unless *Settings → Clipboard Sync → Paste from Other Apps → Allow*; Local Network prompt for LAN databases |

## Sensitive-content hints

Password managers mark clipboard content as "do not record". With *Skip
password-manager content* on (default) the app checks the hint **before**
reading the clipboard:

| Platform | Hint honoured |
|---|---|
| macOS | `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` |
| Windows | `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing` clipboard format |
| Android 13+ | `ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE` |
| iOS, Linux | no standard hint exists — use *Skip keys and tokens* or *Pause capture* |

Pairing: scanning a QR code needs the camera (Android, iOS). Desktops paste
the copied code instead.

## Mobile capture flow

Copy in any app → open Clipboard Sync (or tap **Capture**) → the app reads
the clipboard on resume. Android hands window focus over slightly after the
`resumed` lifecycle event, so the read is delayed 400 ms and retried once.
On iOS the app checks `hasStrings` first, which does not trigger the paste
prompt, and only reads when there is something to read.

## macOS keychain and unsigned builds

Credentials are stored in the login keychain. macOS binds each keychain item
to the signature of the app that created it. Release builds are currently
**unsigned** (ad-hoc signature), so after updating the app macOS shows
"Clipboard Sync wants to use your confidential information stored in …" —
click **Always Allow**. The app never blocks on that prompt: startup reads
only preferences, secrets are loaded after the first frame, and every
keychain call is bounded by a 10 s timeout with a preferences fallback that
is surfaced as a warning in Settings. Code-signing the release (see
`docs/release.md`) removes the prompt entirely.

## Data protection

- Android: `allowBackup="false"` and data-extraction rules exclude all app
  data from cloud backup and device transfer.
- macOS: the app runs without the App Sandbox (it is not distributed through
  the App Store) so it can register the Launch Agent and read the pasteboard
  from the menu bar.
- All platforms: credentials go to the OS credential store; the local history
  database stays in the app's private data directory.
