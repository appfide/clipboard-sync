# Releases

## How a release happens

1. Bump `version:` in `apps/nija/pubspec.yaml` (SemVer) and add a
   `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same PR.
2. Merge to `main`. The **Release** workflow sees the new version, tags
   `v<version>`, builds every installer with `flutter_distributor`, verifies
   each one, and publishes a GitHub Release.
3. Pushing a `v*` tag by hand triggers the same pipeline.

Only one release runs at a time: a second version bump queues behind the first
rather than racing it for the tag.

### What the release ships

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| The installers below | One per platform |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` | Checksum of every file in the release, the SBOM included |
| `nija-<v>-sbom.spdx.json` | SPDX bill of materials for the whole repository |
| Build provenance | Attached to the release, not a file: signed by GitHub through the workflow's OIDC identity |

### Verifying a download

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing     # integrity
gh attestation verify Nija-<v>-macos.dmg --repo appfide/nija   # origin
```

The attestation says which workflow, commit and runner produced that exact
file. A file that was rebuilt or tampered with anywhere between the runner and
the download fails this check, which a checksum alone cannot tell you, because
whoever replaces the file can replace the checksum next to it.

### The verification gate

Before anything is published, `scripts/verify_artifacts.sh` opens each
installer and checks that it is the app it claims to be: bundle identifier
`com.appfide.nija`, the version being released, a binary of plausible size, and
the signing state the release promises (Developer ID and a notarization staple
on macOS, a verified upload-key signature on Android). A build that ships the
wrong identifier or last version's number fails the release instead of reaching
users. Run it locally against a `dist/` directory the same way CI does:

```sh
scripts/verify_artifacts.sh macos 0.4.0 apps/nija/dist
```

| Platform | Artifact | Signed? |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `Nija-<v>-macos.dmg` (arm64; Intel Macs run it via Rosetta) | Developer ID + notarized once the Apple secrets are set (below); ad-hoc otherwise |
| Windows | `…-windows.exe` (Inno Setup) + `.zip` portable | No: see [Windows signing](#windows-signing) |
| Linux | `…-linux.deb`, `…-linux.AppImage` (x86_64) | n/a |
| Android | `…-android.apk`, `.aab` | Debug key unless secrets set |
| iOS | `Nija-<v>-ios-unsigned.ipa` | No: sideload with AltStore/Sideloadly or re-sign |

## Installing unsigned builds

- **macOS keychain prompt**: unsigned builds get a new ad-hoc signature every release, so after an update macOS asks to allow access to the stored credentials, click *Always Allow*. Signing with a Developer ID (below) makes the signature stable and removes the prompt.

- **macOS**: right-click the app → *Open* → *Open*; or
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Nija.app"`.
- **Windows**: SmartScreen → *More info* → *Run anyway*.
- **iOS**: unsigned `.ipa` requires a sideloading tool with your own Apple ID.

## Adding signing (repository secrets)

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Release-sign APK/AAB. Generate: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload`, then `base64 -i upload-keystore.jks`. Without these, CI signs with the debug key, installable, but users cannot upgrade in place across releases. |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` | Developer ID signing + notarization. Wired; see [macOS signing and notarization](#macos-signing-and-notarization) for how to produce each one. All five must be present, the workflow skips signing entirely if `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` is empty. |

Never commit any of these files. `.gitignore`, gitleaks and `scripts/verify_secrets.sh` all reject them.

## macOS signing and notarization

Without this, macOS shows *"Apple could not verify 'Nija.app' is free
of malware"* and the only way in is right-click → *Open* or stripping the
quarantine attribute. Removing that dialog needs a **paid Apple Developer
Program membership** ($99/year): there is no free path, and ad-hoc signing does
not help. Everything else below is a one-time setup; after it, every release is
signed and notarized automatically.

Enrol as an individual and the Gatekeeper dialog shows your own name; enrolling
as the Appfide organisation (needs a D-U-N-S number) makes it show *Appfide*.

1. **Certificate.** Xcode → *Settings* → *Accounts* → your Apple ID → *Manage
   Certificates* → **+** → *Developer ID Application*. It lands in the login
   keychain.
2. **Export it.** Keychain Access → *login* → *My Certificates* → right-click
   *Developer ID Application: …* → *Export* → `.p12`, and set a password. Both
   the private key and the certificate must be in the export (expand the row,
   it should have a key under it).
3. **Encode it.** `base64 -i certificate.p12 | pbcopy`, then delete the `.p12`;
   `.gitignore`, gitleaks and `scripts/verify_secrets.sh` all reject it, but it
   should not sit on disk either.
4. **Team ID.** [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
   → *Membership details* → *Team ID* (10 characters).
5. **App-specific password** for notarization:
   [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) → *Sign-In and Security* →
   *App-Specific Passwords* → **+**. This is not your Apple ID password.
6. **Add the secrets** (repo → *Settings* → *Secrets and variables* → *Actions*,
   or the CLI):

   ```sh
   base64 -i certificate.p12 | gh secret set MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64
   gh secret set MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD    # the .p12 export password
   gh secret set APPLE_ID               # the Apple ID email
   gh secret set APPLE_TEAM_ID          # 10-character team id
   gh secret set APPLE_APP_PASSWORD     # app-specific password
   ```

What the release workflow then does, all on the macOS runner:

- imports the `.p12` into a throwaway keychain and writes
  `macos/Runner/Configs/Signing.xcconfig`, which switches the Release build to
  manual signing with the Developer ID identity, the hardened runtime and a
  secure timestamp;
- builds and packages the dmg as usual, so every framework inside the bundle is
  signed by Xcode's own embed phase;
- signs the dmg, submits it to Apple with `notarytool --wait`, and prints the
  notary log if the verdict is anything but `Accepted`;
- staples the ticket to the dmg and runs `spctl --assess`, which is the check
  the user's Mac performs;
- deletes the keychain and the xcconfig, whether or not the job succeeded.

Notarization usually takes a few minutes but Apple gives no guarantee, so the
macOS job can sit waiting for a while. The certificate is valid for five years;
the app-specific password lasts until you revoke it.

Two things that follow from a stable signature: macOS stops asking to allow
keychain access after every update, and the dmg can be opened by double-clicking
like any other app.

## Windows signing

Not wired, and not a `.pfx` in a secret any more: since June 2023 public CAs
must keep Authenticode keys on an HSM or hardware token, so there is no file to
base64. The realistic options are [Azure Trusted
Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/trusted-signing/) (about $10/month,
designed for CI, individual accounts allowed) or an EV certificate on a cloud
HSM (a few hundred dollars a year). SmartScreen also warms up on its own as a
given binary gets downloaded.

Until then the installer shows *Windows protected your PC* → *More info* →
*Run anyway*.

## Local packaging

```sh
dart pub global activate flutter_distributor
cd apps/nija
flutter_distributor release --name local-macos      # dmg (needs `npm i -g appdmg`)
flutter_distributor release --name local-linux      # deb + AppImage (needs appimagetool)
flutter_distributor release --name local-windows    # exe (needs Inno Setup) + zip
flutter_distributor release --name local-android    # apk + aab
```
